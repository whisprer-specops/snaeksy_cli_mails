[wofl_de-obfscrypt-v-0-1-0.ps1]

[rem: see in start of actul script for full intructions/examples.]


I've created a brand new complete script with everything properly formatted and all features included. This fresh version should work perfectly without any syntax errors.
The script includes all the features we discussed:

Secure file encryption/decryption:

Encrypts files or entire directories
Preserves folder structure when processing recursively
Smart output path handling


Military-grade secure deletion:

Multi-pass overwriting with zeros, ones, and random data
Progress indicators during secure deletion
Configurable number of passes (default is 3)


Empty folder cleanup:

Intelligently removes folders that become empty after secure deletion
Works from deepest to shallowest folders (bottom-up approach)
Only operates when secure deletion is confirmed


User safety features:

Clear confirmation prompts
Detailed progress reporting
Stats summary after operations complete



Just save that script as wofl_obs-descrypt.ps1 (or whatever filename you prefer) and you should be good to go! The file should run smoothly now without any syntax errors or missing braces.
Let me know if you need any other adjustments or if you encounter any other issues, woflfren!
