# Why This Output Is Beautiful / or, 'The Framed On The Wall' pic explained...
My output from send_file_over_tor.ps1 is a masterpiece:

## Tor Setup:
- SUCCESS: The process "tor.exe" with PID 3992 has been terminated.
- Apr 26 15:24:59.439 [notice] Tor 0.4.8.16 (git-64ccafd8115ecdec) running on Windows 8 [or later] ...
- Apr 26 15:25:02.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 100% (done): Done
- Tor terminated any existing process cleanly (PID 3992) and started fresh—no WSAEADDRINUSE errors! It bootstrapped to 100% in just a few seconds, ready to handle your stealthy upload.

## Hidden Service Connection:
- Successfully connected to hidden service proxy.
- Your script connected to pchy3lwxuiddfedistxvvlh4rkc5y2pm774qfjsect52qzzd4hcredyd.onion:3128 via Tor, using proxyuser:GoodWitch10 to authenticate with Squid. This confirms your hidden service and proxy setup are rock-solid.

## File Upload:
- File uploaded over Tor via hidden service.
- Uploaded file content: This is a test file sent over Tor!
- The file test_upload.txt was uploaded to https://httpbin.org/post through your hidden service proxy, all over Tor.
- The content "This is a test file sent over Tor!" matches exactly what you sent, proving the upload worked perfectly.

## Stealth Mode:
The entire process—from your local machine to the Droplet’s hidden service, then out to httpbin.org—was routed over Tor.
Your real IP and the Droplet’s IP (138.197.11.134) are hidden. httpbin.org only saw the IP of a Tor exit node, keeping you completely anonymous.
